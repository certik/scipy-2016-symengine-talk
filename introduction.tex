SymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While SymPy turns out to be
very useful for many applications, one of the long term problems with SymPy is that the
speed might be insufficient when handling of very large expressions is required. Another
problem with SymPy is that due to being written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use
from other languages like Julia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python
to C++ bridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additional overhead.

We will show benchmarks against other computer algebra systems (opensource and commercial)
as well as examples of usage. We will present a roadmap on porting SymPy on top of SymEngine.
We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the code cannot have an
undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease of development as one is used
to from Python).
